# H-index-prediction (Data challenge)
## INF554 Machine and Deep Learning (2021) - Ecole Polytechnique

### Context
The goal of this data challenge is to study and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques
to a real-world regression problem. In this regression problem, each sample corresponds to a researcher
(i. e., an author of research papers), and the goal is to build a model that can predict accurately the
h-index of each author. More specifically, the h-index of an author measures his/her productivity and
the citation impact of his/her publications.

To build the model, we use 2 types of data: (1) a graph that models the collaboration intensity of two individuals (i. e.,
whether they have co-authored any papers), and (2) the abstracts of the top-cited papers of each author.
The problem is very related to the well-studied problems of node regression and text regression.
